<Title style={styles.subHeading}>Our Commitment To You</Title>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>At DateX, your privacy is top priority. Your privacy is at the core of the way we design and build the services and products you know and love, so that you can fully trust them and build meaningful connections.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not take this lightly.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We do not compromise with your privacy. We design all of our products and services with your privacy in mind. We involve experts from various fields, including legal, security, engineering, product design and others to make sure that no decision is taken without respect for your privacy.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We strive to be transparent in the way we process your data. Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we have written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy practices!</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We work hard to keep your information secure. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Welcome to the DateX Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it. We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and technical jargon to a minimum. This Privacy Policy applies beginning 1st September, 2021.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>1. Who We Are</Subheading>
<Text style={styles.text}>The company that is responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy is:</Text>
<Text style={styles.text}>DateX Inc.</Text>
<Text style={styles.text}>KNUST</Text>
<Text style={styles.text}>Kumasi</Text>
<Text style={styles.text}>Ghana</Text>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>This Privacy Policy applies to apps, events and other services operated by DateX. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>3. Information We Collect</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Information you give us</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos. To add certain content, like pictures, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction. Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Information we receive from others</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Other Users </Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Other users may provide information about you as they use our services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Social Media </Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your DateX account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Other Partners</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where DateX ads are published on a partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Information collected when you use our services</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Usage Information</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Device information </Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including: hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google’s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address); information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength; information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={[styles.text, styles.subHeading]}>Other information with your consent </Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>4. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Technologies</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). We use them for things such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including DateX, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</Paragraph>

We may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>7. Cross-Border Data Transfers</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. As an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA. We use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries. Standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>8. Your Rights</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</Paragraph>

<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms). You can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here. #########</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Updating your information. If you believe that information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here. ######### For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released. Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Accountability. You have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>9. How We Protect Your Information</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure. We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures. We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here######### In order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against unauthorized access, theft and loss, we implemented a bug bounty program. For more information about our bug bounty program, please click here. #########</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>10. How Long We Retain Your Information</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law. To protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account deletion. During this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Q. we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some “traffic data” is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>R. we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>S. there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved; or</Paragraph>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>T. the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security. For example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account. Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>11. Children's Privacy</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</Paragraph>

<Subheading style={styles.subHeading}>12. Privacy Policy Changes</Subheading>
<Paragraph style={styles.text}>Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time. We will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</Paragraph>
